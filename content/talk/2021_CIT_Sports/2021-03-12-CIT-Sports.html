abstract: 'Multiple facets of society have been studied in recent times due to the emergence of large-scale datasets arising from digital traces being created each day, these include content popularity on social media, disease spreading, and financial ecosystems. One area that is in a prime position to be studied using such data is the realm of sport which has experienced a surge in data availability in recent times. In this talk I introduce some of our recent work where we study sporting systems including: snooker, football, and fantasy sports, through a combination of mathematical modelling and data analysis.'
