I am a Senior Consultant in the Expert Services division of [Acadia](https://www.acadia.inc/quant-services) where I focus on applying 
techniques from data science and applied mathematics in helping financial groups
including tier-one investment banks and hedge funds perform efficient risk 
calculations and analysis within their portfolios.

My interests include statistics, data science, network science, education, and
public-speaking across a number of domains. This tends to result in working within
a range of programming languages including R, Python, Julia, and SQL.

I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics from the University of Limerick with a
focus on describing the dynamics of complex systems through a combination of mathematical modelling alongside large-scale data analysis. These systems can range from memes, online threads to even Fantasy sports!
