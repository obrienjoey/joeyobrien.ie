I am currently a PhD student at the Universty of Limerick where I work within the [Mathematics Applications Consortium for Science and Industry (MACSI)](https://ulsites.ul.ie/macsi/) supervised by [Prof. James Gleeson](https://staff.ul.ie/gleesonj/) working on describing the dynamics of complex systems through a combination of mathematical modelling alongside large-scale data analysis. These systems can range from memes, online threads to even Fantasy sports!
